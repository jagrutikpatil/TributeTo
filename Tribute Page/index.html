                <h1>Jawaharlal Nehru <br></h1>
                <p><b> prime minister of India</b></p>
                <p>Also Known as:Pandit Nehru
                <p>
                <p class="paragraph1">Jawaharlal Nehru, byname Pandit (Hindi: “Pundit” or “Teacher”) Nehru, (born
                    November 14, 1889, Allahabad, India—died May 27, 1964, New Delhi), first prime minister of
                    independent India (1947–64), who established parliamentary government and became noted for his
                    neutralist (nonaligned) policies in foreign affairs. He was also one of the principal leaders of
                    India’s independence movement in the 1930s and ’40s.</p>
                <h1 id="heading1"> Early years</h1>
                <p>Nehru was born to a family of Kashmiri Brahmans, noted for their administrative aptitude and
                    scholarship, who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a son of Motilal Nehru, a
                    renowned lawyer and leader of the Indian independence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma)
                    Gandhi’s prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two of whom were girls. A
                    sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General
                    Assembly.

                    Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses and tutors. Only
                    one of those—a part-Irish, part-Belgian theosophist, Ferdinand Brooks—appears to have made any
                    impression on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who taught him Hindi and Sanskrit.
                    In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school, where he stayed for two years. Nehru’s academic
                    career was in no way outstanding. From Harrow he went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent
                    three years earning an honours degree in natural science. On leaving Cambridge he qualified as a
                    barrister after two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his own words he passed his
                    examinations “with neither glory nor ignominy.”

                    The seven years Nehru spent in England left him in a hazy half-world, at home neither in England nor
                    in India. Some years later he wrote, “I have become a queer mixture of East and West, out of place
                    everywhere, at home nowhere.” He went back to India to discover India. The contending pulls and
                    pressures that his experience abroad were to exert on his personality were never completely
                    resolved.

                    Four years after his return to India, in March 1916, Nehru married Kamala Kaul, who also came from a
                    Kashmiri family that had settled in Delhi. Their only child, Indira Priyadarshini, was born in 1917;
                    she would later (under her married name of Indira Gandhi) also serve (1966–77 and 1980–84) as prime
                    minister of India. In addition, Indira’s son Rajiv Gandhi succeeded his mother as prime minister
                    (1984–89).</p>

            <p class="paragraph2">In the 35 years from 1929, when Gandhi chose Nehru as president of the Congress
                session at Lahore, until his death, as prime minister, in 1964,
                Nehru remained—despite the debacle of the brief conflict with China in 1962—the idol of his people. His
                secular approach to politics contrasted with Gandhi’s
                religious and traditionalist attitude, which during Gandhi’s lifetime had given Indian politics a
                religious cast—misleadingly so, for, although Gandhi may have
                appeared to be a religious conservative, he was actually a social nonconformist trying to secularize
                Hinduism. The real difference between Nehru and Gandhi was not
                in their attitudes toward religion but in their attitudes toward civilization.
                Whereas Nehru talked in an increasingly modern idiom, Gandhi was harking back to the glories of ancient
                India.The importance of Nehru in the perspective of Indian history is that he imported and imparted
                modern values and ways of thinking, which he adapted to Indian conditions.
                Apart from his stress on secularism and on the basic unity of India, despite its ethnic and religious
                diversities, Nehru was deeply concerned with carrying India forward into the modern age of scientific
                discovery and technological development. In addition, he aroused in his people an awareness of the
                necessity of social concern with the poor and the outcast and of
                respect for democratic values. One of the achievements of which he was particularly proud was the reform
                of the ancient Hindu civil code that finally enabled Hindu widows to enjoy equality with men in matters
                of inheritance and property.</p>

                <img src="./Jawaharlal-Nehru-Indian-Pres-Italian-Antonio-Segni-September-1962.webp" alt="">

            <!-- <h3 class="img1">1929 : Jawaharlal Nehru,Indira Gandhi,<br> and Harry S.Truman.</h3> -->
            <p class="paragraph3">The Sino-Indian conflict of 1962, however, exposed Nehru’s wishful thinking on
                nonalignment. When Chinese forces threatened to overrun the Brahmaputra River valley in the northeast as
                a result of a long-standing border dispute regarding Arunachal Pradesh state, they exposed the
                hollowness of Nehru’s proclamation, “Hindu-Chini bhai bhai” (“Indians and Chinese are brothers”).
                Nehru’s subsequent call for Western aid made virtual nonsense of his nonalignment policy. China soon
                withdrew its troops.
                The Kashmir region—claimed by both India and Pakistan—remained a perennial problem throughout Nehru’s
                term as prime minister. In the months after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947, he made tentative
                efforts to settle the dispute between
                the two new countries while Hari Singh, the maharaja of Kashmir, decided on which country he would join.
                When Singh chose India, however, fighting broke out between the two sides. The UN brokered a cease-fire
                line in the region, and Nehru proposed
                territorial adjustments along the line that failed. That demarcation became the line of control
                that still separates the Indian- and Pakistani-administered portions of the region.</p>
